codesignal python Modulus   [Modulus.py](https://github.com/qsceszwdvrdx/hello/blob/master/codesignal/python/Modulus.py)

To fix this, you've decided to write your own modulus operator as a function. 
Your task is to implement a function that, given a number n, returns -1 if this number is not an integer and n % 2 otherwise.
It is guaranteed that if the number represents an integer, it will be written without a decimal point.

如果該數字不是整數，則n返回-1該函數，n % 2否則返回。如果數字表示整數，則可以保證不帶小數點。
